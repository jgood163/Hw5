                    In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. 
                    The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by 
                    forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.
                    <br>
                    This book is the first of the amazing trilogy. The writing is suspenseful and keeps you engaged. I read the book in less than 48 hours... highly recommend!

                    When it falls to Hanna Heath, an Australian rare-book expert, to conserve this priceless work, the series of tiny artifacts she discovers in its ancient binding-an insect wing fragment, wine stains, salt crystals, a white hair-only begin to unlock its deep mysteries and unexpectedly plunges Hanna into the intrigues of fine art forgers and ultra-nationalist fanatics.
                    <br>
                    This book is mysterious and shows some aspects of ancient history. Not my all time favorite book, but showed great promise and intelect!

                        Despite the tumor-shrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years, Hazel has never been anything but terminal, her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis. But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group, Hazelâ€™s story is about to be completely rewritten.

                        This book combines humor with real life challenges young teens experience when being diagnosed with cancer. The book and movie were both phenomenal. This book will make you laugh and bring you to tears! One of my favorite books of all time.
